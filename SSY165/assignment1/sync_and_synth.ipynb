    "The objective of this home assignment is to get a deeper understanding of some basic features of discrete event systems. This will be achieved by implementing a few key functions in Python, including the computation of coreachable states, the synchronous composition of two automata, as well as the synthesis of a nonblocking and controllable supervisor. These functions are then applied to the analysis of a simple coordination control system.\n",

    "* As before, the following resources will be of great help to you for this assignment:\n",
    "  * Lecture notes\n",
    "  * [Python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/)\n",
    "  * [Google](https://www.google.com)\n",
    "  * [Wikipedia overview of syntax and semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_syntax_and_semantics) \n",
    "* We will work extensively with **sets** in this assignment: \n",
    "  * A set is created either through `set(*iterable*)` or by listing its elements between curly braces `{*iterable*}`; \n",
    "  * An empty set must be created by `set()`. `{}` will create an empty dictionary; \n",
    "  * You will also see often something like `{elem for elem in items if elem}`. This is called a *set comprehension* and builds efficiently a new set by iterating over `items` and adding the `elem` for which the if-statement is true; \n",
    "  * Have an extensive look at [the set documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set) for more information on set methods. Use set methods as much as possible.  \n",
    "* The assignment is written for Python 3.5 or later.\n",
    "* If your code passes all the tests in this notebook, you are on a good way. That does not mean you have passed though! **We will test your code with additional edge cases.** So, convince yourself that everything is correct before you submit, e.g. *through your own test cases*."
